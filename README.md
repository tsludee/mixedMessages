## Where I'm stuck...
I've solved the majority of my problems, I just need to finish styling it to look the way I want it to and then I will be happy!

## Codecademy portfolio project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:

+ Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:
+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command line

### My Plan
Because I taught English for so long, I think that I have the perfect plan: I am going to take my old "Shakespear Insult Generator" assignment and turn it into this random generator.
I want it to have the following items:
+ A button to refresh the insult
+ Three random elements (I think it goes "Thou art a (adjective) (adjective) (noun)")
+ Apologize for being mean and offer a compliment and a well wish for the day ahead!
+ Some of that good good HTML and CSS to make it look sharp!
