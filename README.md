# mixedMessages
Codecademy portfolio project

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:

+ Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on your computer

## Prerequisites:
+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command line

### My Plan
Because I taught English for so long, I think that I have the perfect plan: I am going to take my old "Shakespear Insult Generator" assignment and turn it into this random generator.
I want it to have the following items:
+ A button to refresh the insult
+ Three random elements (I think it goes "Thou art a (adjective) (adjective) (noun)")
+ An option to choose a compliment as well (same formula as the insult... but nice).
+ Some of that good good HTML and CSS to make it look sharp!

### Guidance from CA
To truly be random, CA suggests using three possible strings. Maybe there can be an element that could follow and tell you something about your day? Maybe a third and final one that could say something about your outfit?

### Where I'm stuck...
Now I am trying to add a button functionality, but I don't know where/how to do that. I have a button inserted and I have a lot of the JavaScript ready to go, but it isn't quite workign the way I want it to. I want to click the button and have the insult generator run and print the result to the text box.
